---Display---
console.log(); = Write to console
alert(); = Display a notification
comments are similar to html - //comment or /*comment*/

---Variables---
1.)Syntax (let, const, var))

let = mutable or changing variable
let name = 'test'; = String declaration & assignment.
note: javascript supports dynamic typing.
Can reassign value without let keyword. (name = 'test2')

const = not mutable/changeable.
const PI = 3.1415; declaration and assignment in one.
const PI; just declaration.

var = legacy variables (should be avoided now).
var name = 'test'; String declaration & assignment.

console.log(typeof name); = logs var. type in console. (there is a legacy bug where null returns 'object').

2.)Rules 
Names can't start with a number, cannot be reserved javascript keywords, and must only contain letters, numbers, underscores (_), or dollar signs ($). 

3.)Best practices are to have full CAPS for constants. (i.e. PI = 3.14)

4.)Primitive Data Types:
    I. Number - 1 or 1.0
    I. String - "Text"
    I. Boolean - true or false
    IV. Undefined - named, but not assigned value
    V. Null - Empty or void of value
    VI. Symbol - Unique and unchanged
    VII. BigInt - Number that is to large to store in I.
