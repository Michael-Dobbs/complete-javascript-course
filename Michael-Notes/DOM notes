## ---DOM---

1.) DOM = Document Object Model

It is a structured representation of HTML documents. Allows Javascript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them (essentially a connection between JS and HTML).

DOM is not part of JS, but actually Web API's from browsers that can be accessed

2.) DOM Structure

Document is considered a JS object.

Hierarchy
Document -> HTML -> Main Elements (body, section, title) -> Child Elements (p, H2, <img>)

## ---DOM Manipulation---

1.) Selecting HTML Elements in Javascript
document.querySelector('.classname').childattribute;
